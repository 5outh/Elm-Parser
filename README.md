Elm-Parser
==========

Parser Combinator Library for the Elm programming language.

Note: Due to issues with tail recursion in JS, this library doesn't function as nicely as it should -- it's very easy to get stack overflows even with simple instructions. Mostly, this library is provided as a proof-of-concept. Everything works properly, barring any errors implicit in the JS runtime.
